# JDBC-project-with-preparedStatement
Welcome to my JDBC project! ðŸš€ This application showcases a robust implementation using Java's JDBC API with Prepared Statements for secure and efficient database interactions.
**Key Components**:-

1).Connection: Manages the connection to the database with a focus on reliability and performance.

2).Controller: Orchestrates the flow between the user interface and the data layer.

3).DAO (Data Access Object): Encapsulates database access logic, ensuring clean separation of concerns.

4).DTO (Data Transfer Object): Facilitates smooth data transfer between the layers of the application.
